## Context
>  "When I first got into the business and was doing a lot of vinyl disc cutting, one producer after another just wanted to have his 45 sound louder than the next guy's so that when the program director at the Top 40 radio station was going through his stack of 45s to decide which two or three he was going to add that week, that the record would kind of jump out to the program director, aurally at least." - Bob Ludwig, mastering engineer

Since the advent of recorded music, there has been a trend of increasing audio levels. This is true today, still, where music, at least anecdotally, seems louder than ever. Today's top audio engineers, operating in a post-loudness-war world, employ a wide variety of processing techniques to increase percieved loudness, such as compression, equalization, saturation, and more.
